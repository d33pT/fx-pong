# Pong

This is the first in (hopefully) a series of classic game programming examples. What better game to
start with than good old Pong?

See the introducing [blog post](http://asipofjava.blogspot.be/2014/05/classic-game-programming-pong.html)
for more information.

## Installing and running

If you're new to Git and/or Maven, see this [blog post](http://asipofjava.blogspot.be/2014/05/installing-and-running-example-projects.html)
on how to install and run my example projects. Note that you'll need to run the **master** branch on
JDK 8, while the **ios** branch requires JDK 7. The **ios** branch also requires a Mac with Xcode
installed.

## Retro Game I

The **ios** branch started as an experiment aimed at learning more about [RoboVM](http://www.robovm.org/).
This experiment was very successful, resulting in [Retro Game I](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/retro-game-i/id876950489),
only the second JavaFX app on the App Store. The steps I took to port the game to iOS are summarized
in this [blog post](http://asipofjava.blogspot.be/2014/05/pong-aka-retro-game-i-available-in-app.html).
